DNSUnderstanding the Journey of a URL: What happens when you type ‘https://www.google.com' and press Enter?

Introduction
My friend, have you ever wondered about the journey that occurs when you type ‘https://www.google.com' into your browser and hit that enter key? It’s like a fast-paced safari through the wilds of the internet, with each part of the process playing a crucial role in delivering the webpage to your screen. Let’s take a closer look at this fascinating adventure.

Principle 1: DNS Request
Imagine you’re trying to visit a friend but only know their name, not their address. That’s where the Domain Name System, or DNS, comes in. It translates ‘www.google.com' into an IP address, a unique identifier that serves as the ‘home address’ on the internet.

Principle 2: TCP/IP
Now we know where we’re going, but how do we get there? That’s where Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) comes in. Like a trusted tour guide, TCP/IP sets the rules of the journey, making sure our request reaches the right destination and returns safely.

Principle 3: Firewall
Along the way, we must pass through a security checkpoint called a firewall. It’s like the rangers who protect our wildlife, making sure only safe and allowed traffic passes through.

Principle 4: HTTPS/SSL
Notice the ‘https://' in the URL? That ‘s’ stands for secure, meaning our safari is happening on a safe, encrypted connection. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is like the armored vehicle we’re traveling in, protecting us from any potential threats.

Principle 5: Load-Balancer
Once we reach Google’s servers, we encounter a hardworking gatekeeper called a load balancer. It ensures the traffic is distributed evenly across servers, so no single server gets overwhelmed, just like how a good guide would make sure all members of a tour group get equal attention.

Principle 6: Web Server
The web server is like the destination lodge where our requested webpage is stored. On receiving our request, it fetches the webpage and sends it back to us.

Principle 7: Application Server
Sometimes, the web server needs to chat with an application server, the chef who cooks up dynamic webpages using data from various sources, preparing the specific dish we ordered.

Principle 8: Database
The application server might need ingredients from a pantry known as the database. It’s where all the data associated with the website is stored and organized, ready to be used as needed.

Conclusion
My friend, this incredible safari from typing ‘https://www.google.com' to viewing the page happens in a blink of an eye, showcasing the marvels of modern web technology. Next time you hit enter, remember you’re setting off on a high-speed journey through the virtual savannah of the internet.
